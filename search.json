["","CHICKEN EXPRESSIONS Merrilee Hepler and Tom Sandercock Introduction: My husband, Tom Sandercock (lovingly known as Sander), and I are backyard chicken owners. The experience of being a chicken owner admits you to a “club” of sorts. To be a chicken owner is to join a group of people who typically love eggs, enjoy a challenge, and get a kick out of chicken antics. Living in the Chicagoland area, the “club’s” blogs are also awash with daily worry about summer and winter weather when our chickens face extreme heat and cold. Despite the challenges, the chickens provide us joy and the opportunity to observe them. They are beautiful birds, each with their own personality. Suddenly, all of the chicken metaphors and idioms (“sayings”) made complete sense. We saw those sayings in action. It didn’t hurt that my mother’s conversation since my childhood has been peppered with sayings and, as a result, I frequently use them. This led to an interest in the origin of such sayings. When you put all of this together, Sander and I thought it would be fun to solely use today’s online technology to research chicken sayings and illustrate them. Combining the background of the idiom or metaphor through online research with an artistic depiction using Artificial Intelligence seemed like an intriguing concept – the timeline of human interpretation of chicken behavior pre-online to exclusively online. In reporting our findings, we’ve noted our online resources for each image and its origin. Our own “color” commentary is added when either the image or the origin of a saying was especially intriguing.

Origin: It’s said that the initially started as writing to looking like chicken feet. The natural evolution from feet to scratch seems to make sense as a visual depiction of the act of chicken’s scratching and the result it leaves on the ground. Several references to origin are reported by the online resource poetry-contingency: A German work as translated in English by Sofie Delffs, Leipzig, 1872, depicts the saying by description, “Hornebog, drawing his sword, pierced the parchment with it, and presented it to his companion, steels on the point of the blade. What do you these hooks and chicken feet mean?” In 1899, the publication Gentleman Farmer, vol. 6 stated, “The hand-writing in our public schools looks now like chicken feet, and should our children be compelled to study the chicken language they would soon become chicken- hearted too.” T.W. Higginson described Emily Dickonson’s writing in 1891 as “famous fossil bird tracks.” In 1909, a character in the play “Roger of Rutland: A Drama in Four Acts” by Lewis F. Bostelmann describes his character’s writing (who happens to be Shakespeare) as “…that resembles more a chicken’s feet that puts the art of writing to shame.” Source: https://poetry-contingency.uwaterloo.ca/chicken- scratch/ AI: Midjourney -- chicken_feet_chicken_writing_signature ","Don’t count your chickens before they hatch Best not to assume success until everything planned to be done is accomplished.

Aesop was a Greek storyteller who lived lived from 620-564 BC.

Origin: It was surprising to find that the origin of “hen party” was most often available at wedding sites. The Scottish Tie the Knot explained the origin of the Ancient Greece ritual of a woman preparing to marry. The custom, much like now, was for the bride to spend time with female friends, family, and relatives preparing for the marriage. Later in the 1620s, “hen” was used as slang for a woman and in1800 a publication used ‘hen party” to describe a women’s gathering. A favorite finding was that the saying was applied to a Christmas party hosted by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940: “Christmas hen party for cabinet wives and ladies of the press.” Source: https://tietheknot.scot/a-brief-history-of-the-hen-party- why-do-we-have-them/ AI: no artist, Midjourney party_with_real_chickens_beautiful_hens ","You are no spring chicken Making reference to someone that is not young with the inference that this is not a good thing or that the person may be limited in some way due to age.

Fun fact: In the 1920s, a boy, Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe, on vacation with his parents became fascinated by the behaviors of a barnyard of chickens. By the age of 10, he had detailed descriptions of the chickens’ social order and in his adult years was an expert in the field of birth behavior.

The best resource we found was from idomorigins.org: “A scratch player, particularly, one in golf, denotes one so highly accomplished that he or she plays with no advantage or handicap This usage dates from the mid=19th century. To start from scratch has now come to mean start from the beginning and this usage dates in English from the late 18th century when a line was scratched in the ground to mark the starting point of a race. …It must be remembered, however, that scratching lines in the ground to signify a starting point for a footrace must be very ancient and is recorded from Homeric times, from at least 750 BC. To scratch meaning to withdraw from a races dates from the mid-19th century, but derives from a different source because here the runner’s or horse’s name was literally scratched of the list. Scratch is also slang for money or wages and dates from the early 20th century from the notion of scratching for a living and as such is not related to any of the earlier meanings” This information makes one consider a search for when money began to be referred to as scratch.

The surprise was not knowing how pathetic and irritable a wet hen looks, it was that the origin is from a farmer’s work with the hen. An article from the Pensacola News Journal reported that “when hens sit on eggs, they sometimes have periods of broodiness, when they get grumpy and aggressively protective of the eggs. Farmers would often dunk them in cold water to shock them out of that funk.” Me thinks we’ll avoid this option.

A male may make noise and try to demonstrate leadership, but in the end it is the female that gets the job done. Origin: Finally, a feminist statement that appear in many settings. By far, this was the saying that produced the most information. A precursor saying using a different phrasing was in circulation by 1659 as noted in an entry in “The Wordsworth Dictionary of Proverbs”: The cock crows but the hen goes. 1659: Howell, 19. 1670: Ray, 5. 9. A strong conceptual match written in heavy dialect was printed in 1881 in “Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings: The Folk-lore of the Old Plantation” by Joel Chandler Harris. Harris became famous in the 1800s recording and printing tales from the African-American oral tradition: Rooster makes mo’ racket dan de hin w’at lay de aig. In 1883 a Californian periodical called “The San Francisco Merchant” printed a statement expressing a similar idea with wordplay: The most useful lay member of society is not the rooster who does the crowing. In 1907 a Denver, Colorado newspaper printed an instance with the word “cock” instead of “rooster” that was similar to the phrase credited to Thatcher. A remark about the quote was appended: *8+“The cock crows,” says the Canon City Canon, “but the hen lays the egg.” In 1914 a newspaper in Grand Rapids, Michigan printed an article about a poultry show that gave two versions of the saying in the headline and in the first sentence: HENS DELIVER GOODS, ROOSTERS MAKE FUSS, Why does the rooster crow when the hen lays an egg? ","The rooster may crow but the hen delivers the eggs. (Continued) In 1916 a columnist “Walt Mason: The Poet Philosopher” embedded the expression in an extended commentary: Please note this little fact, I beg: It is the hen that lays the egg; the rooster does the yelling; he flaps his silly wings and crows, and points with pride a while, and throws some fits around your dwelling. And every time I hear him whoop and prance around the chickencoop, a-feeling hunkydory, I think of husbands I have known, who think that they, and they alone, deserve the praise and glory. In 1944 a newspaper in Richmond, Virginia printed an advertisement for a realtor company that included the saying which was oddly designated a “new proverb” from England: “The cock crows, but the hen lays the egg.” The rooster makes more racket than the hen that lays the egg. In 1963 a Springfield, Massachusetts paper published this instance:[13] Chickens are all mixed up. The hen lays the egg and the rooster crows. In 1989 the Sunday Times of London printed Robert Skidelsky’s memory of a dinner party in 1987 with Margaret Thatcher where she remarked in conversation: “The cocks may crow, but it’s the hen that lays the egg,” In 1992 at a fundraising event in San Francisco, the Governor of Texas, Ann Richards, said the following: “As we say in Texas, the rooster may crow, but the hens deliver the goods.” Source: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/14/hen-lays/ AI: artist-Beksinski, Command: A picture of a rooster and a hen.

Origin: There are a number of competing theories for the origin of ‘egg on one’s face.’ A leading theory is that it comes from rowdy “lower class” theatrical performances where the audience would sometimes throw eggs at a performer’s face if the performance was not good, such as in the Victorian theater during the 1800s or the later Vaudeville acts or from other situations where an unhappy crowd would throw (often rotten) eggs at someone, such as a politician. Also, during the slapstick comedies of the Victorian era, actors would sometimes use break eggs on the forehead of a “fall guy” to make him look foolish and add to the comedy. This was the Victorian equivalent of a pie in the face and could also be a possible origin. More recently, the idiom was recorded as early as the 1950s and was heard on the Front Page Detective television series, which aired from July 6, 1951, to September 19, 1952. Some claim that it specifically originated with political candidates during the 1960s, based on the notion that people would throw eggs at a candidate’s face to make them look foolish or ridiculous. Finally, two other origin theories deserve documentation, because they make sense as origin stories no matter the century! One origin theory states that “egg on your face” derives from people with sloppy eating habits who would often have egg yolk around their mouths after eating breakfast. Others claim it comes from dogs who would sneak into chicken coups to eat eggs and would invariably show their guilt by having traces of egg on their muzzles. Sources: World Wide Words: Egg on one’s face AI: ","Rule the Roost Someone who is head of the household, team, job, etc. Most often the person that “rules the roost” requires certain activities be completed in a certain way. Origin: This expression originated in the 15th century as rule the roast, which is thought to be either a corruption of rooster or alluded to the person who was in charge of the roast and thus ran the kitchen. In the barnyard a rooster decides which hen should roost near him. Both interpretations persisted for 200 years. Thomas Heywood (c. 1630) put it as “Her that ruled the roast in the kitchen,” but Shakespeare had it in 2 Henry VI (1:1): “The new-made duke that rules the roast,” which is more ambiguous. In the mid-1700s roost began to compete with roast, and in the 1900s roost displaced roast altogether.

Another is when two people move fast towards each other most often with a car or motorcycle. The one who veers for safety is considered the “chicken.” We beg to differ! Origin: The first example we have of chicken meaning a coward comes in 1600 in William Kemp's Nine Days' Wonder: \"It did him good to have ill words of a hoddy doddy! a hebber de hoy!, a chicken! a squib.\" Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit (1844): \"Why, what a chicken you are! You are not afraid of being robbed, are you?“ From a coward one moves on to a weak or naïve person: W Godwin, Caleb Williams (1794): \"You are not such a chicken as to suppose, if so be as you are innocent, that that will make your game altogether sure.“ And the term is especially well-known in the phrase to play chicken, a contest of nerve in which two cars drive towards either each other or an obstacle, cliff edge, etc – the loser being the driver who turns aside first; thus any form of foolish dare-devilry.

An early definition appeared in The Atheneum of 1864: “A bad egg ... a fellow who had not proved to be as good as his promise.” In contrast, the schoolyard saying “last one in is a rotten egg” does not have any special significance other than as a way of urging others to join an activity, jump in the water, or the like.
